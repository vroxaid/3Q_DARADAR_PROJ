	<aside id="body"><h1>Our Advocacy</h1>
	<p>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. 
	Women’s health services, already poorly funded, have faced 	major disruptions. Violence against women remains endemic. 	And 	despite women’s leadership in responding to COVID-19, they 	still trail men in securing the decision-making positions they 	deserve.</p></aside>
	<aside id="body"><h1>Background</h1>
	<p>Today, gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress. Women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. Across the globe, women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid domestic work. Inequalities faced by girls can begin right at birth and follow them all their lives. In some countries, girls are deprived of access to health care or proper nutrition, leading to a higher mortality rate.</p></aside>
